                            take control of your time and do things at your own pace. Sales also give you the freedom to
                            work the way you want to work. It gives you freedom to express yourself your way.</p>
                        <p class="lh-1">It is also a career path wherein risks are low and the rewards can be as high as
                            you want. The harder you work, the more rewards you earn therefore personal gratification is
                            reinforced which in turn gives you more confidence in what you do.</p>

                        <p class="lh-1">We all know that it is a basic need for each and every one of us, which means
                            that it is something that will always be in demand. For us Filipinos, owning a piece of
                            property is a sign of stability, a person or a family is on its way up.</p>
                        <p class="lh-1">We also know that real estate isn’t exactly an unlimited thing. This is where
                            the Law of Supply and Demand comes in. If the demand for real estate is higher than its
                            supply, the prices of real estate increase. This is the main reason why properties
                            appreciate in value as time passes. This is also why real estate is what most
                            multi-millionaires tend to invest on; it is a measure of wealth. Real estate is also a good
                            hedge for inflation and a good source of passive income.</p>
