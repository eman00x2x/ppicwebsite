                    <p class="lh-1">First of all, it breaks the monotony of a 9 to 6 job. Being in sales lets you
                        take control of your time and do things at your own pace. Sales also give you the freedom to
                        work the way you want to work. It gives you freedom to express yourself your way.</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">It is also a career path wherein risks are low and the rewards can be as high as
                        you want. The harder you work, the more rewards you earn therefore personal gratification is
                        reinforced which in turn gives you more confidence in what you do.</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">And lastly, you’ll find yourself enjoying being in sales, that is if you like
                        meeting new people and seeing different places.</p>

                    <h1 class="fw-bold">Why Real Estate?</h1>
                    <p class="lh-1">We all know that it is a basic need for each and every one of us, which means
                        that it is something that will always be in demand. For us Filipinos, owning a piece of
                        property is a sign of stability, a person or a family is on its way up.</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">We also know that real estate isn’t exactly an unlimited thing. This is where
                        the Law of Supply and Demand comes in. If the demand for real estate is higher than its
                        supply, the prices of real estate increase. This is the main reason why properties
                        appreciate in value as time passes. This is also why real estate is what most
                        multi-millionaires tend to invest on; it is a measure of wealth. Real estate is also a good
                        hedge for inflation and a good source of passive income.</p>
