                    <p class="lh-1">First of all, it breaks the monotony of a 9 to 6 job. Being in sales lets you take control of your time and do things at your own pace. Sales also give you the freedom to work the way you want to work. It gives you freedom to express yourself your way.</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">It is also a career path wherein risks are low and the rewards can be as high as you want. The harder you work, the more rewards you earn therefore personal gratification is reinforced which in turn gives you more confidence in what you do.</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">And lastly, you’ll find yourself enjoying being in sales, that is if you like meeting new people and seeing different places.</p>

                    <p class="lh-1">We all know that it is a basic need for each and every one of us, which means that it is something that will always be in demand. For us Filipinos, owning a piece of property is a sign of stability, a person or a family is on its way up.</p>
                    <p class="lh-1">We also know that real estate isn’t exactly an unlimited thing. This is where the Law of Supply and Demand comes in. If the demand for real estate is higher than its supply, the prices of real estate increase. This is the main reason why properties appreciate in value as time passes. This is also why real estate is what most multi-millionaires tend to invest on; it is a measure of wealth. Real estate is also a good hedge for inflation and a good source of passive income.</p>
